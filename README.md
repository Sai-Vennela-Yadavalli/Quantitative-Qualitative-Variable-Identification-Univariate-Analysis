# 📊 Quantitative & Qualitative Variable Identification – Univariate Analysis

This repository contains code and notebooks for identifying **quantitative** and **qualitative** variables from a dataset as part of univariate analysis in data preprocessing.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To separate dataset columns into:
- **Quantitative Variables** – Numeric columns
- **Qualitative Variables** – Categorical columns

This step is essential in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to decide appropriate statistical techniques and visualizations for each type.
